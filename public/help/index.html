          <h4>General questions</h4>
          <details>
            <summary>Is CaretTab free to use?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes! There are many features within that are free. If you are looking for increased customization however,
              that can be found by subscribing to Premium Access.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Are there advertisements in the extension?</summary>
            <p>None at all!</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Does CaretTab track my data? / Can the developer see my data?</summary>
            <p>
              Nope. Nor do I want to! The extension does not require any accounts, does no tracking, has no
              advertisements, and no unnecessary data collection. There isn't even any analytics involved (with the
              exception of this site and the store listings).
            </p>
            <p>
              Your data and settings are saved to your browser's internal storage. No data is saved on any CaretTab
              servers. The only time your data or settings will be placed on a server would be if you are signed into
              your browser and have enabled syncing, in which case it is only synced with your browser maker's servers.
              CaretTab only offers it to be synced but does not have any access to that data outside your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only time any data is saved to CaretTab databases is when you sign up for Premium Access, in which
              case your email and payment information is stored on
              <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stripe</a>
              for payment processing, and that is all.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't just talk either, CaretTab's source code is Open Source and freely available on
              <a href="https://github.com/bluecaret/carettab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

            <summary>What/who is BlueCaret and CaretTab, I'm confused by the names!</summary>
            <p>
              Understandable confusion! "BlueCaret" is the screen name/alias for the owner and developer of this site
              and the CaretTab extension, and is also the name of the business it is all listed under. "CaretTab" is the
              name I gave this Chrome Extension that replaces the New Tab page. CaretTab is listed in the Web Stores
              under the publisher name of BlueCaret. This is also why pages such as the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
              bring you to bluecaret.com.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What permissions does CaretTab use?</summary>
            <p>
              CaretTab attempts to use minimal permissions when possible. If anything is not needed at the start, you
              will be prompted for the optional permission when enabling the feature that requires it. Below is a list
              of the permissions CaretTab uses and why:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Used to store your settings in the browser's storage area.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Replace the page you see when opening a new tab</strong>: Used to replace the New Tab page with
                this extension.

                permission are used to retrieve data for CaretTab to function.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>https://extensionpay.com/*</strong>: This is the payment provider CaretTab users. It is
                    required to allow payments for Premium Access to work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>https://fonts.googleapis.com/*</strong>: The fonts available in the extension are from
                    Google Fonts; this URL is where the fonts are loaded from.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>https://dtfv5mvrx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/*</strong>: This is an Amazon Web
                    Services server that CaretTab accesses to retrieve various data such us API access for weather among
                    other data. Data is only ever retrieved from this address, never sent.
                  </li>

                    (Optional) <strong>https://developer.sepush.co.za/*</strong>: Used to retrieve data for the
                    Loadshedding widget.

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                (Optional) <strong>Read the icons of the websites you visit</strong>: Used to display the favicons
                (logos) of the website you add to your quick links.
              </li>

                (Optional) <strong>Read and change your bookmarks</strong>: Used to display your browser bookmarks on

            </ul>
          </details>

          <h4>Premium Access</h4>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I sign up for Premium Access?</summary>
            <p>
              Once you have CaretTab installed, open a New Tab and open the settings panel by clicking the settings
              button in the bottom right corner. In the settings panel you should see a blue "Get Premium Access"
              button, select that, and then click the "Subscribe now" button. A popup window should open (be sure your
              browser isn't blocking the popup!) with a form requesting your email and payment info. Once filled out,
              click "Subscribe" and your done! The New Tab page should show a confirmation and then reload the page to
              enjoy the extra features!
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Are there yearly or lifetime subscription options? What about a trial?</summary>
            <p>
              Unfortunately not at this time. I plan on adding this later, however the payment provider I use does not
              currently support it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There also is no trial option at the moment, though I may consider adding one at a later time. Clicking
              around the settings panel, you'll notice little blue gems around, these mark the features that are part of
              Premium Access, you should be able to get an idea of what it would be like by looking at these options.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>I had to reinstall CaretTab, how do I get my Premium Access back?</summary>
            <p>
              If you are currently subscribed to Premium Access you can login on a new browser or machine by going to
              the same "Get Premium Access" button in the settings panel you used to sign up. Once the sign up popup
              window opens, click the "Log in" button instead of filling out the form. You will be asked for your email
              address. Once you submit the login, a link will be emailed to you from "Extension Login" with the subject
              line "Login link for CaretTab". In the browser you are using CaretTab, open the link in the email. This
              will complete the log in process, open a new tab and enjoy your Premium Access.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I cancel my Premium Access subscription?</summary>
            <p>
              You can manage or cancel your subscription from within the settings panel of CaretTab. Open the settings
              panel, and click the "You have Premium Access. Manage subscription" button on the bottom of the panel,
              then click the blue "manage" button. A popup window will appear (be sure your browser isn't blocking the
              popup!) showing you details of your subscription with the ability to cancel.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have difficulties or have already uninstalled the extension, please reach out with the form above,
              including the email address you subscribed with, and I can manually cancel your subscription.
            </p>
          </details>

          <h4>Using the extension</h4>

          <details>
            <details>
              <summary>How do I save my changes to settings?</summary>
              <p>
                Anytime you close the settings panel your changes are automatically saved. You can also click the save
                button in the top right corner at any time to save without closing. In addition, some actions such as
                adding or removing widgets will automatically save in that moment. You can revert some changes by simply
                refreshing or closing the tab before closing the settings panel; anything that was changed since opening
                the settings should revert back.
              </p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>How do I sync my settings between browsers?</summary>
              <p>
                Settings sync is automatically enabled when you sign into your browser, providing the browser supports
                syncing. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge should both sync your settings when signed into each
                respectively.
              </p>
              <p>It is currently not possible to sync your settings between different types of browsers.</p>
              <p>
                Another option available is exporting your settings from one browser and importing them to the other.
                This option can be found in the Settings Dashboard, under "Extension settings", select "Advanced
                settings" and you will see an Export and Import option. Note that this is a manual process and any time
                you make changes to your settings you will want to perform the export/import process again.
              </p>
            </details>

            <summary>Where did the color theme options go?</summary>
            <p>
              As of version 4.0.0, settings for widgets have greatly improved including allowing you to individually set
              the colors of widgets. Due to this it no longer made sense to combine the background and text colors in
              the same area. To set the wallpaper color, from the Settings Dashboard, click the Wallpaper section, and
              then click the color field. To set the text colors, open the "Widget Font Styles" section in the Dashboard
              and change the color field; or edit a specific widget and change the color from the "Widget Font Styles"
              section within the widget's settings.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Why is the widget not showing on the page?</summary>
            <p>
              There are a few possibilities. First, make sure the widget is not disabled on the Settings Dashboard;
              ensure the toggle is on next to the widget name in the list of widgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, you might need to try adjusting the options within the "Widget Container" section of the widget's
              settings. The widget being set too small or large, or the position is too far one direction or the other,
              could all contribute to the widget not being visible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, it could be the text color of the widget is the same or similar to the background color. Try
              adjusting the color options under "Widget Font Styles".
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Why is the shadow not showing?</summary>
            <p>Be sure that the shadow is enabled via the "Enable" option at the top right of the shadow menu.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>The widgets don't seem to be matching with the size I set.</summary>
            <p>
              Different widgets may behave differently to the size options available. For example, you could set the
              weather widget to a very small width in the container settings, but it still may display wider as the
              content within will keep with the layout. This can cause the content to "overflow" the widget's container.

              One way to avoid this when designing your tab is by clicking the square icon at the top right of the
              Settings panel, it's the button to the right of the eye. Enabling this option will show an outline around
              all widget containers, this makes it easy to tell if any content is overflowing. The option will
              automatically be disabled when you open a new tab, or you can click it again to disable.

              While you are here, try the next button to the right that looks like a dotted grid. This option overlays a
              grid on the tab page, making it easy to align widgets.
